#Code Kata
This repo is used for code kata excercises

## Usage
Your source code should go in the `Src` directory and will be autoloaded in the `Src` namespace

Your tests should go in the `Test` directory and will only be autoloaded if you do a `composer install` or `composer update` with `--dev`

Tests can be executed by running `./phpunit` in the root directory of the project. The default settings that *PHPUnit* will run with can be seen in the `phpunit.xml` file
